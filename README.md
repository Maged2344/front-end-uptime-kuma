# Uptime Kuma Docker Deployment

This repository contains a **GitHub Actions workflow** that automates the deployment of the `uptime-kuma` Docker container. The workflow builds and deploys the container to a server, ensuring it is always up-to-date and running smoothly.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Uptime Kuma** is a self-hosted status monitoring solution that can be used to monitor the uptime of your services. This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:
- **Stops** any running `uptime-kuma` containers.
- **Removes** the old container.
- **Runs** a new container with the latest `uptime-kuma` image, using Docker.

The workflow uses Docker to manage the container lifecycle and ensures that the `uptime-kuma` service is always running and available on port `3001`.
